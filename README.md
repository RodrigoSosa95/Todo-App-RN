## Todo App RN

This is a simple todo app made with React Native as a small demo of my skills.

To run the application the application properly it is recommended to have the following requirements fulfilled

 - react-native-cli version 2.0.1
 - react-native version 0.57.2

You must also bear in mind to have your machine properly setup to develop react native apps.

To run the application just clone the project and inside of the project folder in your machine enter the command `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android` I would suggest to run the command `react-native start --reset-cache` to run the bundler and then execute the previous commands mentioned 

Once launched the app should be running on your device or simulator

Enjoy and thanks!
